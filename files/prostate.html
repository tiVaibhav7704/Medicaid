            Prostate cancer is cancer that occurs in the prostate. The prostate is a small walnut-shaped gland in males that
            produces the seminal fluid that nourishes and transports sperm.Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of
            cancer. Many prostate cancers grow slowly and are confined to the prostate gland, where they may not cause serious
            harm. However, while some types of prostate cancer grow slowly and may need minimal or even no treatment, other 
            types are aggressive and can spread quickly.

          <p>
            About of prostate cancer can be caused by a wide range of disorders, infections and events including:
            Doctors know that prostate cancer begins when cells in the prostate develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA 
            contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The changes tell the cells to grow and divide more rapidly 
            than normal cells do. The abnormal cells continue living, when other cells would die.The accumulating abnormal cells 
            form a tumor that can grow to invade nearby tissue. In time, some abnormal cells can break away and spread 
            (metastasize) to other parts of the body
