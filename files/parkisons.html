          Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. Symptoms start gradually, sometimes starting with a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. 
          Tremors are common, but the disorder also commonly causes stiffness or slowing of movement.

          In the early stages of Parkinson's disease, your face may show little or no expression. Your arms may not swing when you walk. 
          Your speech may become soft or slurred. Parkinson's disease symptoms worsen as your condition progresses over time.

          Although Parkinson's disease can't be cured, medications might significantly improve your symptoms. 
          Occasionally, your doctor may suggest surgery to regulate certain regions of your brain and improve your symptoms.

            No specific test exists to diagnose Parkinson's disease. Your doctor trained in nervous system conditions (neurologist) will diagnose Parkinson's disease based on your medical history, a review of your signs and symptoms, and a neurological and physical examination.

            Your doctor may suggest a specific single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scan called a dopamine transporter scan (DaTscan). Although this can help support the suspicion that you have Parkinson's disease, it is your symptoms and neurologic examination that ultimately determine the correct diagnosis. 
            Most people do not require a DaTscan .
