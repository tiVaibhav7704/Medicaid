            At the entrance to your stomach is a valve, which is a ring of muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). 
            Normally, the LES closes as soon as food passes through it. If the LES doesn't close all the way or if it opens too 
            often, acid produced by your stomach can move up into your esophagus. This can cause symptoms such as a burning chest 
            discomfort called heartburn. If acid reflux symptoms happen more than twice a week, you may have acid reflux disease, 
            also known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)        </p>

          <p>
            The symptoms associated with acidity include:

               <p>
                1.Patients experience a burning sensation in the stomach, a burning sensation in the throat and heart.</p>
                <p>2.Frequent burping or hiccups for no apparent reason.</p> 
                  <p>3.Burning sensation and pain in the chest .</p>
                    <p>4.Prolonged sour taste in the mouth or bitter-tasting acid that backs up into your throat and mouth.</p>

      <h2>Cause</h2>
      <div class="land">
        <div class="lname">
          <p>
            About of acidity can be caused by a wide range of disorders, infections and events including:

               <p>
                The food we eat passes down the oesophagus into the stomach. </p>
                <p>The gastric glands in the stomach create acid i.e. 
                HCL (Hydrochloric acid with pH =4) which is necessary to digest the food and to kill any germs.</p><p> Acidity occurs 
                when the gastric glands produce a large amount of acid, more than what is needed for the digestion process.</p> <p>
                In some, the amount of acid is high, or the end of one’s food pipe is open.</p> <p>There is a valve between our food pipe 
                and stomach, which keeps this area closed, but in some cases, this area is not closed, it remains open, and because 
                of that, the stomach acid bounces up again and again.

        <h2>Diagnosis of acidity</h2>

            Successful treatment depends on diagnosing the cause. Investigations may include:

               <p>
                1.Barium swallow (esophagram) can check for ulcers or a narrowing of the esophagus. You first swallow a solution 
                to help structures show up on an X-ray.</p>
                <p> 2.Esophageal manometry can check the function and movement of the esophagus and lower esophageal sphincter.</p>
                  <p> 3.pH monitoring can check for acid in your esophagus. The doctor inserts a device into your esophagus and leaves 
                it in place for 1 to 2 days to measure the amount of acid in your esophagus.</p>
                <p>4.Endoscopycan check for problems in your esophagus or stomach. This test involves inserting a long, flexible, 
                lighted tube with a camera down your throat. First, the doctor will spray the back of your throat with anesthetic 
                and give you a sedative to make you more comfortable.</p>
                <p> 5.A biopsymay be taken during endoscopy to check samples of tissue under a microscope for infection or abnormalities.

          <p>
            Always see your doctor if you experience serious symptoms. Babies and young children with acidity need prompt medical attention.
Treatment for acidity depends on the cause, but may include:

               <p>
                Usually, acidity is treated with the help of antacids which contain either magnesium or calcium or aluminium containing
                compounds. These antacids neutralise the excess acid in the stomach thus providing relief from the symptoms. Read about
                food dos and don’ts for acidity.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, histamine blocking agents (H2 receptor blockers) such as cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine or nizatidine or
                proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole and lansoprazole can also be prescribed by your physician. In rare cases, 
                surgery (vagotomy) is performed to reduce the acid sensation. Here's how to relieve indigestion,gas and irritable 
                bowel syndrome with yoga.
