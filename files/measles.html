            Measles is an acute viral respiratory illness. It is characterized by a prodrome of fever (as high as 105°F) and malaise,
            cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis -the three “C”s -, a pathognomonic enanthema (Koplik spots) followed by a maculopapular
            rashexternal icon. The rash usually appears about 14 days after a person is exposed. The rash spreads from the head to the
            trunk to the lower extremities. Patients are considered to be contagious from 4 days before to 4 days after the rash appears.
            Of note, sometimes immunocompromised patients do not develop the rash.

            About of measles can be caused by a wide range of disorders, infections and events including:

               <pre>
                Measles is a highly contagious virus that lives in the nose and throat mucus of an infected person. It can spread to others
                through coughing and sneezing.If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, 
                noses, or mouths, they can become infected.Animals do not get or spread measles.

        <h2>Diagnosis of measles</h2>
      <div class="land">

          <p>
            Successful treatment depends on diagnosing the cause. Investigations may include:

               <pre>
                Your doctor can usually diagnose measles based on the disease's characteristic rash as well as a small, bluish-white spot
                on a bright red background — Koplik's spot — on the inside lining of the cheek. However, many doctors have never seen measles, 
                and the rash can be confused with a number of other illnesses. If necessary, a blood test can confirm whether the rash is truly 
                measles. The measles virus can also be confirmed with a test that generally uses a throat swab or urine sample.

      <h2>Treatment of measles</h2>
      <div class="land">
        <div class="lname">
          <p>
            Always see your doctor if you experience serious symptoms. Babies and young children with measles need prompt medical attention.
Treatment for measles depends on the cause, but may include:

               <pre>
                1.Post-exposure vaccination. Nonimmunized people, including infants, may be given the measles vaccination within 72 hours of 
                exposure to the measles virus to provide protection against the disease. If measles still develops, the illness usually has milder 
                symptoms and lasts for a shorter time.
                2.Immune serum globulin. Pregnant women, infants and people with weakened immune systems who are exposed to the virus may receive an 
                injection of proteins (antibodies) called immune serum globulin. When given within six days of exposure to the virus, these antibodies 
                can prevent measles or make symptoms less severe
