          <p>
            Symptoms normally begin between 6 and 30 days after exposure to the bacteria.
            The two major symptoms of typhoid are fever and rash. Typhoid fever is particularly high, gradually increasing
            over several days up to 104 degrees Fahrenheit, or 39 to 40 degrees Celsius.
            The rash, which does not affect every patient, consists of rose-colored spots, particularly on the neck and abdomen.
            Other symptoms can include:</p>
            
            <P>1.weakness</P>
          <P>2.abdominal pain</P>
        <P>3.constipation</P>
      <P>4.headaches</P>
    <P>Rarely, symptoms might include confusion, diarrhea, and vomiting, but this is not normally severe.
            In serious, untreated cases, the bowel can become perforated. This can lead to peritonitis, an infection of the tissue
            that lines the inside of the abdomen, which has been reported as fatal in between 5 and 62 percentTrusted Source of
            cases.Another infection, paratyphoid, is caused by Salmonella enterica. It has similar symptoms to typhoid, but it is
            less likely to be fat</P>

      <h2>Cause</h2>
      <div class="land">
        <div class="lname">
          <p>
            About of typhoid can be caused by a wide range of disorders, infections and events including:

               <pre>
                Typhoid is caused by the bacteria S. typhi and spread through food, drinks, and drinking water that are contaminated
                with infected fecal matter. Washing fruit and vegetables can spread it, if contaminated water is used.
                Some people are asymptomatic carriers of typhoid, meaning that they harbor the bacteria but suffer no ill effects.
                Others continue to harbor the bacteria after their symptoms have gone. Sometimes, the disease can appear again.
                People who test positive as carriers may not be allowed to work with children or older people until medical tests
                show that they are clear.

        <h2>Diagnosis of typhoid</h2>
      <div class="land">
        <div class="lname">
          <p>
            Successful treatment depends on diagnosing the cause. Investigations may include:

               <pre>
                Your doctor is likely to suspect typhoid fever based on your symptoms and your medical and travel history.
                The diagnosis is usually confirmed by identifying Salmonella typhi in a culture of your blood or other body 
                For the culture, a small sample of your blood, stool, urine or bone marrow is placed on a special medium that encourages the growth of
                bacteria. The culture is checked under a microscope for the presence of typhoid bacteria. A bone marrow culture
                often is the most sensitive test for Salmonella typhi.
                Although performing a culture test is the most common diagnostic test, other testing may be used to confirm a
                suspected typhoid fever infection, such as a test to detect antibodies to typhoid bacteria in your blood, or a
                test that checks for typhoid DNA in your blood.fluid or tissue
                
              
                
               </pre>

      <h2>Treatment of tphoid</h2>
      <div class="land">

          <p>
            Always see your doctor if you experience serious symptoms. Babies and young children with typhoid need prompt medical attention.
Treatment for typhoid depends on the cause, but may include:

               <pre>
                Antibiotic therapy is the only effective treatment for typhoid fever.
                Commonly prescribed antibiotics
                Commonly prescribed antibiotics include:
                
                1.Ciprofloxacin (Cipro). In the United States, doctors often prescribe this for adults who aren't pregnant.
                  Another similar drug called ofloxacin also may be used. Unfortunately, many Salmonella typhi bacteria are no
                  longer susceptible to antibiotics of this type, particularly strains picked up in Southeast Asia.
                2.Azithromycin (Zithromax). This may be used if a person is unable to take ciprofloxacin or the bacteria are 
                  resistant to ciprofloxacin.
                3.Ceftriaxone. This injectable antibiotic is an alternative in more-complicated or serious infections 
                  and for people who may not be candidates for ciprofloxacin, such as children.
                4.These drugs can cause side effects, and long-term use can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant 
                  bacteria.
