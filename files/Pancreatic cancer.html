          Pancreatic cancer begins in the tissues of your pancreas â€” an organ in your abdomen that lies behind the lower part of your stomach. 
          Your pancreas releases enzymes that aid digestion and produces hormones that help manage your blood sugar.</p>

        <p>Several types of growths can occur in the pancreas, including cancerous and noncancerous tumors. 
          The most common type of cancer that forms in the pancreas begins in the cells that line the ducts that carry digestive enzymes out of the pancreas (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma).</p>

        <p>Pancreatic cancer is seldom detected at its early stages when it's most curable. 
          This is because it often doesn't cause symptoms until after it has spread to other organs.

            It's not clear what causes pancreatic cancer. Doctors have identified some factors that may increase the risk of this type of cancer,
             including smoking and having certain inherited gene mutations.  
             Factors that may increase your risk of pancreatic cancer include:
             <p>1.smoking</p>  
             <p>2.Family history of genetic syndromes that can increase cancer risk, including a BRCA2 gene mutation, 
               Lynch syndrome and familial atypical mole-malignant melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome</p>
            <p>3.Older age, as most people are diagnosed after age 65</p>  
            <p>4.Family history of pancreatic cancer</p>

          <p>
            If your doctor suspects pancreatic cancer, he or she may have you undergo one or more of the following tests:</p>
                
            <p>1.Imaging tests that create pictures of your internal organs.</p>
            <p>2.Using a scope to create ultrasound pictures of your pancreas. </p>
            <p>3.Removing a tissue sample for testing (biopsy).</p>

            Operations used in people with pancreatic cancer include:</p>
            <p>1.Surgery for tumors in the pancreatic head.</p>
            <p>2.Surgery for tumors in the pancreatic body and tail. </p>
            <p>3.Surgery to remove the entire pancreas.</p>
