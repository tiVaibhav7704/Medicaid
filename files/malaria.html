          Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by a parasite. People with malaria often experience fever, chills, and flu-like
          illness. Left untreated, they may develop severe complications and die. In 2019 an estimated 229 million cases of malaria
          occurred worldwide and 409,000 people died, mostly children in the African Region. About 2,000 cases of malaria are
          diagnosed in the United States each year. The vast majority of cases in the United States are in travelers andimmigrants
          returning from countries where malaria transmission occurs, many from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

          <p>
            About of malaria can be caused by a wide range of disorders, infections and events including:

               <pre>
                1.Uninfected mosquito:A mosquito becomes infected by feeding on a person who has malaria.
                2.Transmission of parasite: If this mosquito bites you in the future, it can transmit malaria parasites to you.
                3.In the liver:Once the parasites enter your body, they travel to your liver — where some types can lie dormant for as long as a year.
                4.Into the bloodstream: When the parasites mature, they leave the liver and infect your red blood cells. This is when people typically develop malaria symptoms.
                5.On to the next person :If an uninfected mosquito bites you at this point in the cycle, it will become infected with your malaria parasites and can spread them to the other people it bites.

            Successful treatment depends on diagnosing the cause. Investigations may include:

               <pre>
                Your provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms and travel history. It’s important to share
                information about the countries you’ve visited recently so that your provider can clearly understand your risk.
                To confirm a malaria diagnosis, your provider will take a sample of your blood and send it to a lab to check for
                malaria parasites. The blood test will indicate whether or not you have malaria and will also identify the type 
                of parasite that’s causing your symptoms. This information helps your provider determine the right treatment.

            Always see your doctor if you experience serious symptoms. Babies and young children with malaria need prompt medical attention.
Treatment for malaria depends on the cause, but may include:

               <pre>
                Treatment for malaria should start as soon as possible. To treat malaria, your provider will prescribe drugs to
                kill the malaria parasite. Some parasites are resistant to malaria drugs. The type of medication and length of
                treatment depend on which parasite is causing your symptoms.
                 Antimalarial drugs include:
                1.Artemisinin drugs (artemether and artesunate).
                2.Atovaquone (Mepron®).
                3.Chloroquine.
                4.Doxycycline (Doxy-100®, Monodox®, Oracea®).
                5.Mefloquine.
                6.Quinine.
