        <p>
            Hepatitis B is a vaccine-preventable liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV).
            Hepatitis B is spread when blood, semen, or other body fluids from a person infected with the
            virus enters the body of someone who is not infected. This can happen through sexual contact; sharing needles,
            syringes, or other drug-injection equipment; or from mother to baby at birth. Not all people newly infected with 
            HBV have symptoms, but for those that do, symptoms can include fatigue, poor appetite, stomach pain, nausea, and 
            jaundice. For many people, hepatitis B is a short-term illness. For others, it can become a long-term, chronic infection
            that can lead to serious, even life-threatening health issues like cirrhosis or liver cancer. Risk for chronic infection
            is related to age at infection: about 90% of infants with hepatitis B go on to develop chronic infection, whereas only 
            2%–6% of people who get hepatitis B as adults become chronically infected. The best way to prevent hepatitis B is to get vaccinated.

          <p>
            About of hepatitis B can be caused by a wide range of disorders, infections and events including:

               <p>
              <p>1.sex with an infected partner</p>
              <p>2.injection-drug use that involves sharing needles, syringes, or drug-preparation equipment</p>
               <p>3.birth to an infected mother</p>
              <p>4.contact with blood from or open sores on an infected person</p>
              <p> 5.exposures to needle sticks or sharp instruments</p>
              <p> 6.sharing certain items with an infected person that can break the skin or mucous membranes</p>
              <p> (e.g., razors, toothbrushes, and glucose monitoring equipment), potentially resulting in exposure to blood.</p>

        <h2>Diagnosis of Hepatitis B</h2>
      <div class="land">

          <p>
            Successful treatment depends on diagnosing the cause. Investigations may include:

               <p>
                1.Blood tests. Blood tests can detect signs of the hepatitis B virus in your body and tell your doctor whether it's acute or chronic.
                A simple blood test can also determine if you're immune to the condition.</p>
              <p>2.Liver ultrasound. A special ultrasound called transient elastography can show the amount of liver damage.</p>
            <p>3.Liver biopsy. Your doctor might remove a small sample of your liver for testing (liver biopsy) to check for liver damage. </p>
          <p> During this test, your doctor inserts a thin needle through your skin and into your liver and removes
                a tissue sample for laboratory analysis.
               </p>
          </p>

      <h2>Treatment of Heptatis B</h2>
      <div class="land">
        <div class="lname">
          <p>
            Always see your doctor if you experience serious symptoms. Babies and young children with Heptatis B need prompt medical attention.
Treatment for Heptatis B depends on the cause, but may include:

               <p>
                1.Antiviral medications. Several antiviral medications — including entecavir (Baraclude), tenofovir (Viread), lamivudine (Epivir), 
                adefovir (Hepsera) and telbivudine (Tyzeka) — can help fight the virus and slow its ability to damage your liver. These drugs are 
                taken by mouth. Talk to your doctor about which medication might be right for you.</p>
              <p> 2.Interferon injections. Interferon alfa-2b (Intron A) is a man-made version of a substance produced by the body to fight infection.
                 It's used mainly for young people with hepatitis B who wish to avoid long-term treatment or women who might want to get pregnant
                  within a few years, after completing a finite course of therapy. Interferon should not be used during pregnancy. Side effects may 
                  include nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing and depression.</p>
                <p>3.Liver transplant. If your liver has been severely damaged, a liver transplant may be an option. During a liver transplant, the surgeon
                 removes your damaged liver and replaces it with a healthy liver. Most transplanted livers come from deceased donors, though a small
                  number come from living donors who donate a portion of their livers.
