            Chickenpox is an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It causes an itchy rash with small, fluid-filled 
            blisters. Chickenpox is highly contagious to people who haven't had the disease or been vaccinated against it. Today, 
            a vaccine is available that protects children against chickenpox. Routine vaccination is recommended by the U.S. 
            Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

            About of chickenpox can be caused by a wide range of disorders, infections and events including:

               <p>
                Chickenpox infection is caused by the varicella-zoster virus.</p><p> It can spread through direct contact with the rash.</p>
              <p> It can also spread when a person with the chickenpox coughs or sneezes and you inhale the air droplets.</p>

        <h2>Diagnosis of chickenpox</h2>
      <div class="land">
        <div class="lname">
          <p>
            Successful treatment depends on diagnosing the cause. Investigations may include:

               <p>
                A doctor or nurse will know whether a child or adult has chickenpox by recognizing a person’s tell-tale rash and 
                asking a few questions about their symptoms.</p><p>In cases when a person is not vaccinated and is not sure whether they 
                have had chickenpox as a child, they can get a laboratory test to determine whether they did have the virus in the 
                past.People who have had chickenpox as children will not get the disease again.</p><p> This is because they develop 
                immunity to the virus. If a person who has been exposed to someone with chickenpox is not sure if they had the 
                illness as a child, getting tested can help them know if they are at risk for getting the disease.</p><p>Another reason 
                to get tested is to help a doctor distinguish the symptoms of chickenpox from other conditions with similar 
                symptoms. One of those conditions may be shingles.</p>

      <h2>Treatment of chickenpox</h2>
      <div class="land">

          <p>
            Always see your doctor if you experience serious symptoms. Babies and young children with chickenpox need prompt medical attention.
Treatment for chickenpox depends on the cause, but may include:

               <p>
                1.Pain-relieving drugs: Tylenol (acetaminophen) may help reduce high fever and pain when a person has chickenpox. But it is important to follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer and the person’s doctor. People should not use aspirin-containing products to treat chickenpox, as this can lead to complications. People should also avoid ibuprofen, as it could increase the risk of strep throat.</p>
              <p>2.Avoiding dehydration: It is important to drink plenty of fluids, preferably water, to prevent dehydration, which can be a complication of chickenpox.</p>
            <p>3.Sugar-free popsicles: These can help ease symptoms of mouth soreness if there are spots in the mouth. Avoid salty or spicy foods. If chewing is painful, soup might be a good option, as long as it is not too hot.</p>
          <p>4.Reduce itching: Itching can become severe, but it is important to minimize scratching to reduce the risk of scarring. Things that can help include topical ointments, cool baths, or oral Benadryl tablets.</p>
        <p>The following may also help prevent scratching:</p>

      <p>.keeping fingernails clean and as short as possible</p>
    <p>.placing mittens or even socks over a child’s hands when they go to sleep, so that any attempt at scratching during the night does not cut the skin</p>
  <p>.wearing loose clothing</p>
<p>.A doctor may prescribeTrusted Source antiviral medication during pregnancy, for adults who get an early diagnosis, for newborns, and for those with a weakened immune system.</p>
