            Bronchitis occurs when the bronchioles (air-carrying tubes in the lungs) are inflamed and make too much mucus.
            There are two basic types of bronchitis:</p>
          <p> 1.Chronic bronchitis is defined as cough productive of sputum that persists for three months out of the year for at least 
            two consecutive years. The cough and inflammation may be caused by initial respiratory infection or illness, exposure to tobacco
            smoke or other irritating substances in the air. Chronic bronchitis can cause airflow obstruction and then is grouped under the
            term chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p>
          <p> 2.Acute or short-term bronchitis is more common and usually is caused by a viral infection. Episodes of acute bronchitis can be 
           related to and made worse by smoking. Acute bronchitis could last for 10 to 14 days, possibly causing symptoms for three weeks.

               <p>
                Usually, acute bronchitis is brought on by a viral infection, though it may also be caused by a bacterial infection. The flu 
                and colds are examples of viral infections.</p><p>Chronic bronchitis is usually, but not always, caused by smoking tobacco. It can also 
                be caused by exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke, apollution, dust, or toxic gases. </p><p>Your risk can be increased by family history
                of bronchitis, having asthma and allergies, and having gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

                Your healthcare provider will do a physical examination and take a medical history. They may ask if you have had a cold recently, how long
                your cough has lasted, and if you produce mucus when you cough.</p><p> In addition,they may order a chest X-ray, tests for viruses in your upper
                respiratory secretions or blood tests.

                might use over-the-counter drugs that break up mucus or that treat fever or pain. </p>

                might prescribe antibiotics.If you have chronic bronchitis, treatment will be different.</p><p> Chronic bronchitis, considered to be 
                chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is not curable. Symptoms can be treated using a variety of methods, including drugs, 
                oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, surgery, or a combination of these. </p><p>Your doctor might prescribe a mucus clearing device,
