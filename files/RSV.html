            Respiratory syncytial (sin-SISH-uhl) virus, or RSV, is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms.
            Most people recover in a week or two, but RSV can be serious, especially for infants and older adults. RSV is the most common 
            cause of bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia (infection of the lungs) in children younger 
            than 1 year of age in the United States.

                2.Decrease in appetite

          <p>
            About of RSV can be caused by a wide range of disorders, infections and events including:

               <pre>
                1.An infected person coughs or sneezes
                2.You get virus droplets from a cough or sneeze in your eyes, nose, or mouth
                3.You touch a surface that has the virus on it, like a doorknob, and then touch your face before washing your hands
                4.You have direct contact with the virus, like kissing the face of a child with RSV

        <h2>Diagnosis of RSV</h2>
      <div class="land">
        <div class="lname">
          <p>
            Successful treatment depends on diagnosing the cause. Investigations may include:

               <pre>
                Because mild RSV symptoms are similar to the common cold, testing usually isn't required to diagnose the infection.
                However, your doctor may suspect RSV based on your medical history, time of year and a physical exam. In this case, they may
                want to run lab tests to confirm the diagnosis. The most common is a mouth swab or a blood test to check white blood cell
                counts and look for viruses.
                In severe RSV cases that require hospitalization, additional testing may be needed. Imaging tests, such as a chest X-ray or 
                CT scan can check for lung complications. Blood and urine cultures may be necessary when infants are very sick, as RSV-related 
                bronchiolitis can occur with a urinary tract infection in newborns.

          <p>
            Always see your doctor if you experience serious symptoms. Babies and young children with RSV need prompt medical attention.
Treatment for RSV depends on the cause, but may include:

               <pre>
                1.Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your upper shirt sleeve, not your hands
                2.Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
                3.Avoid close contact, such as kissing, shaking hands, and sharing cups and eating utensils, with others
                4.Clean frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs and mobile devices
