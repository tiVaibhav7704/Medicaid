            Mumps is a contagious disease that is caused by a virus. It typically starts with a few days of fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and
            loss of appetite. Then most people will have swelling of their salivary glands(often referred to as parotitis when the parotid gland, 
            located in front and below the ear, swells).This is what causes the puffy cheeks and a tender, swollen jaw.

            Successful treatment depends on diagnosing the cause. Investigations may include:

               <pre>
                The doctor can usually diagnose mumps based on the swollen salivary glands. If the glands are not swollen and the doctor 
                suspects mumps based on other symptoms, he or she will perform a virus culture. A culture is done by swabbing the inside of
                the cheek or throat. The swab collects mucus and cells and is sent to a lab to be tested for the mumps virus.
                It is important to remember than many viruses other than mumps can cause swelling of the salivary glands.

            Always see your doctor if you experience serious symptoms. Babies and young children with mumps need prompt medical attention.
Treatment for mumps depends on the cause, but may include:

               <pre>
                The mumps vaccine is the best method for preventing mumps; it can come on its own or as part of the MMR vaccine.
                 The MMR vaccine also defends the body against rubella and measles.
