        <p>
            Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a potentially disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).</p><p>In MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath (myelin) that covers nerve fibers and causes communication problems between your brain and the rest of your body.  </p>
           <p> Eventually, the disease can cause permanent damage or deterioration of the nerves. </p><p>Some people with severe MS may lose the ability to walk independently or at all, while others may experience long periods of remission without any new symptoms.</p>

      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <div class="land">
        <div class="lname">
          <p>
            The cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown.</p> <p>It's considered an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. In the case of MS, this immune system malfunction destroys the fatty substance that coats and protects nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord (myelin).</p>
                <p>Myelin can be compared to the insulation coating on electrical wires. When the protective myelin is damaged and the nerve fiber is exposed, the messages that travel along that nerve fiber may be slowed or blocked.</p>
                <p>It isn't clear why MS develops in some people and not others. A combination of genetics and environmental factors appears to be responsible.</p>

        <h2>Diagnosis of multiple scelerosis</h2>
      <div class="land">
        <div class="lname">
          <p>
            To diagnose multiple scelerosis, your doctor may conduct a physical exam and check for signs and symptoms of Graves' disease. </p>
                <p>1.Blood tests. </p>
                <p>2.Spinal tap (lumbar puncture).</p>
                <p>3.MRI.</p>
                <p>4.Evoked potential tests</p>

      <div class="land">

          <p>
            Treatment options for multiple scelerosis include:</p>
                <p>1.Corticosteroids->such as oral prednisone and intravenous methylprednisolone, are prescribed to reduce nerve inflammation. Side effects may include insomnia, increased blood pressure, increased blood glucose levels, mood swings and fluid retention.</p>
                <p>2.Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis)->The liquid portion of part of your blood (plasma) is removed and separated from your blood cells. The blood cells are then mixed with a protein solution (albumin) and put back into your body. Plasma exchange may be used if your symptoms are new, severe and haven't responded to steroids..</p>
