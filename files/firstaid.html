        <p>
            First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person suffering from either a minor or serious illness or injury, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery. First aid is generally performed by someone with basic medical training
        </p>
        <p> First aid can include everything from bandaging a minor wound to preventing shock to keeping someone's heart beating during a cardiac event. Ideally, it should be performed by someone who's taken a class and is certified in first aid, but if no one is available, anyone with some basic knowledge can pitch in. </p>
         
      </div>
<h1>Some Basic First-Aid Procedures</h1>
    <h2>1.CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation)</h2>
    <div class="land">
      <div class="lname">
        <p>
            Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the most important medical procedure of all. 
            If a person is in cardiac arrest (the heart is no longer pumping blood) and CPR is not performed, 
            that person will die. On the other hand, performing CPR or using an AED could save a life.
         <h3>First Aid for Suspected Cardiac Arrest</h3>
             <pre>
              1.Get someone to call 911 or the medical alert system for your location.

              2. Start chest compressions immediately.
                 Push down hard and fast in the center of the chest,
                allowing the chest to come back up naturally between
                compressions.Continue until someone with more training has arrived.

              3.If you're trained in CPR, use chest compressions and rescue breathing.

              4.Use an AED if one is available. It's important to not delay chest 
              compressions, though, so have someone else find one while you do chest 
              compressions.

    <h2>2.Bleeding</h2>
    <div class="land">
      <div class="lname">
        <p>
            Bleeding is usually fairly obvious, especially if it's severe. While it is important to stop the bleeding, remember the ABCs and check first for something more serious.
         <h3>First Aid for Bleeding</h3>
             <pre>
               1. Rinse the wound with water if possible.

               2. Cover the wound with a gauze or cloth .

               3. Apply direct pressure to stop the blood flow and encourage clotting.

               4. If possible, elevate the bleeding body part above the heart.
            
               5.Don't remove the cloth if it becomes soaked through, 
               but add more layers if needed. Removing the first layer will 
               interfere with the clotting process and result in more blood loss.

               6.Once bleeding is stopped, apply a clean bandage.

    <div class="land">
      <div class="lname">
        <p>
            Choking due to a windpipe obstruction is a serious situation that can make someone lose consciousness and even die if the obstruction isn't removed. Procedures are different for babies who are less than a year old.</p>
         <h3>First Aid for Choking</h3>
             <pre>
                1.Stand behind the person and lean them slightly forward
                2.Put your arms around their waist
                3.Clench a fist and place it between their navel and rib cage
                4.Grab your fist with your other hand
                5.Pull the clenched fist sharply backward and upward under their 
                rib cage in 5 quick thrusts. Repeat until the object is coughed up.

                For someone who's obese or pregnant, 
                perform thrusts around the chest 
                instead of the abdomen.
                
                If someone is unconscious:
                
                1.Place them on their back and kneel over them
                2.Place the heel of your hand slightly above the navel
                3.Place your other hand on top of it
                4.Give quick upward thrusts to dislodge the obstruction

        <p>
            The first step to treating a burn is to stop the burning process.13 Chemicals need to be cleaned off. Electricity needs to be turned off. Heat needs to be cooled down with running water. Sunburn victims need to be covered up or go inside.</p>
         <h3>First Aid for Burns</h3>
             <pre>
                1.Flush the burned area with cool running water for several minutes.

                2.Do not use ice.

                3..Apply a light gauze bandage.

                4.Take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain relief if necessary.

                5.Do not break any blisters that may have formed.

                6.Do not apply ointments, butter, or oily remedies to a burn.

        <p>
            Blisters are designed to protect the damaged skin underneath while it heals. Popping them not only disrupts this natural healing process, but it can also let in bacteria that cause an infection.
         <h3>First Aid for Blisters</h3>
             <pre>
               1. Wash your hands and sterilize a needle with alcohol.

               2. Make small punctures at the edge of the blister.

               3. Gently push the fluid out.

               4.Apply antibiotic ointment.

               5.Bandage it.

               6.If possible, protect the area from further rubbing or pressure.

               If the blister broke open on its own:
                
                1.Gently wash with clean water only.

                2.Smooth the flap of broken skin over the
                 newly exposed skin, unless it's dirty, torn,
                  or pus has gathered under it.

                3.Apply petroleum jelly.

                4.Bandage it.

                5.Change the bandage any time it gets wet. 
                Take it off when you go to bed so the area can dry.

        <p>
            Any injury to your limbs, hands, and feet needs to be treated as a broken bone (fracture) until an X-ray can confirm whether it's broken. While fractures do need medical treatment so they can heal properly, they don't all require an ambulance or an emergency trip to the hospital.</p>
         <h3>First Aid for Broken Bone or Fracture </h3>
             <pre>
               1. Don't try to straighten it.

               2. For a limb, use a splint and padding to immobilize it.

               3. Put a cold pack on the injury, with a barrier between it
                  and the skin to prevent tissue damage. If ice is all that's 
                  available, put it in a plastic bag and wrap it in a shirt or towel.

               4. If it's an extremity, elevate it.

               5. Give anti-inflammatory drugs like Advil or Aleve for pain.

            A sprain is an injury to ligaments, which are connective tissues that holds bones, cartilage, and joints together. Sprains are generally caused by a violent wrenching or twisting of a joint, which over-stretches or tears the ligament. Common places for a sprain are the ankle and wrist.

            Most of us have had a bloody nose at some time in our lives. It simply means bleeding from the inside of the nose due to trauma. The biggest cause of a nosebleed is digital trauma—otherwise known as picking it. It can also be caused by environmental factors, medical conditions (some minor, some serious), medications, and recreational drugs. Causes include:

             <pre>
               1.Lean slightly forward, not back.

               2.Pinch the nose just below the bridge, high 
                 enough that the nostrils aren't pinched closed.

               3.Check after five minutes to see if bleeding has stopped. 
                 If not, continue pinching and check after another 10 minutes.

               4.You can also apply a cold pack to the bridge of the nose while pinching.

        <p>
            Frostbite occurs when the body's tissues freeze deeply in the cold—ice crystals form in the tissues and damage your cells. This is the opposite of a burn, but the damage it does to your skin is almost identical.</p>
         <h3>First Aid for Frostbite</h3>
             <pre>
                1.Get out of the cold.

                2.Immerse the affected area in warm water 
                (98 to 105 F) for 20 to 30 minutes.

                3.Do not rub the affected area.

                4.Do not use sources of dry heat 
                (like a heating pad or fire air).

                5.For fingers and toes: After they're warm,
                 put clean cotton balls between them.

                6.Loosely wrap the area with bandages.

                7.Use Tylenol or Advil for pain.

                8.Get medical attention as soon as possible.

                For small areas of minor frostbite, 
                you can also warm the area with skin-to-skin contact.
                
                Get emergency treatment if the skin is hard and begins turning white.

            Bee stings are annoyingly painful for most people, but they can be deadly for those who are allergic to bee venom.
            An allergy to bees can develop at any time, even in someone who's been stung many times before, so it's important to always watch for signs of an allergic reaction after a sting. Just about any bee sting will cause pain, redness, and swelling.
         <h3>First Aid for Bee Sting</h3>
             <pre>
               1.Get the stinger out any way you can to keep it
                from injecting more venom.
                The method doesn't matter—it's most important to do it quickly.
               2. Wash the area with soap and water.

               3. Use a cold pack to reduce swelling at the site, 
                   but don't apply ice directly to the skin. 

               4. Use an antihistamine like Benadryl 
                  (diphenhydramine) to reduce swelling and itching. 

               5. Use Advil or Tylenol for pain.
