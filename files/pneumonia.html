            Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material),
            causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi,
            can cause pneumonia.Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most serious for infants and young children,
            people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems.

          <p>
            A bout of pneumonia can be caused by a wide range of disorders, infections and events including:

               <pre>
                Many germs can cause pneumonia. The most common are bacteria and viruses in the air we breathe.
                Your body usually prevents these germs from infecting your lungs. But sometimes these germs can overpower your 
                immune system, even if your health is generally good.Pneumonia is classified according to the types of germs that 
                cause it and where you got the infection.
                It may be caused by:
                Bacteria. The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in the U.S. is Streptococcus pneumoniae. This type of pneumonia 
                can occur on its own or after you've had a cold or the flu. It may affect one part (lobe) of the lung, a condition called 
                lobar pneumonia.Bacteria-like organisms. Mycoplasma pneumoniae also can cause pneumonia. It typically produces milder symptoms 
                than do other types of pneumonia.Walking pneumonia is an informal name given to this type of pneumonia, which typically isn't 
                severe enough to require bed rest.Fungi. This type of pneumonia is most common in people with chronic health problems or weakened 
                immune systems, and in people who have inhaled large dose of the organisms. The fungi that cause it can be found in soil or bird 
                droppings and vary depending upon geographic location. Viruses, including COVID-19. Some of the viruses that cause colds and the 
                flu can cause pneumonia. Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years. Viral pneumonia is 
                usually mild. But in some cases it can become very serious. Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) may cause pneumonia, which can become
                severe.

            Successful treatment depends on diagnosing the cause. Investigations may include:

               <pre>
                1.medical history
                2.physical examination
                3.blood tests
                4.laboratory analysis of stool sample

      <h2>Treatment of pneumonia</h2>
      <div class="land">

          <p>
            Always see your doctor if you experience serious symptoms. Babies and young children with pneumonia need prompt medical attention.
            Treatment for pnemonia depends on the cause, but may include:

               <pre>
                1.Get vaccinated. Vaccines are available to prevent some types of pneumonia and the flu. Talk with your doctor about getting 
                these shots.The vaccination guidelines have changed over time so make sure to review your vaccination status with your doctor 
                even if you recall previously receiving a pneumonia vaccine.
                2.Make sure children get vaccinated. Doctors recommend a different pneumonia vaccine for children younger than age 2 and for 
                children ages 2 to 5 years who are at particular risk of pneumococcal disease. Children who attend a group child care center 
                should also get the vaccine. Doctors also recommend flu shots for children older than 6 months.
                3.Practice good hygiene. To protect yourself against respiratory infections that sometimes lead to pneumonia, wash your hands 
                regularly or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
                4.Don't smoke. Smoking damages your lungs' natural defenses against respiratory infections.
                5.Keep your immune system strong. Get enough sleep, exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet.
