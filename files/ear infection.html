        <p>
            An ear infection (sometimes called acute otitis media) is an infection of the middle ear, the air-filled space behind
            the eardrum that contains the tiny vibrating bones of the ear. Children are more likely than adults to get ear infections.
            Because ear infections often clear up on their own, treatment may begin with managing pain and monitoring the problem. 
            Sometimes, antibiotics are used to clear the infection. Some people are prone to having multiple ear infections. This 
            can cause hearing problems and other serious complications.

            About of ear infection can be caused by a wide range of disorders, infections and events including:

               <p>
                Bacteria, like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae (nontypeable)â€”the two most common bacterial causes
                Viruses, like those that cause colds or flu.

          <p>
            Successful treatment depends on diagnosing the cause. Investigations may include:

               <p>
                Your healthcare provider will examine your ears with an instrument called an otoscope that has a light and magnifying lens. Examination may reveal:</p>

              <p> 1.redness, air bubbles, or pus-like fluid inside the middle ear</p>
            <p>2.fluid draining from the middle ear</p>
            <p>3.a perforation in the eardrum</p>
            <p>4.a bulging or collapsed eardrum

      <h2>Treatment of ear infection</h2>
      <div class="land">

          <p>
            Always see your doctor if you experience serious symptoms. Babies and young children with ear infection need prompt medical attention.
Treatment for ear infection depends on the cause, but may include:

               <p>
                1.Prevent common colds and other illnesses. Teach your children to wash their hands frequently and thoroughly and
                 to not share eating and drinking utensils. Teach your children to cough or sneeze into their elbow. If possible, 
                 limit the time your child spends in group child care. A child care setting with fewer children may help. Try to 
                 keep your child home from child care or school when ill.</p>
                <p>2.Avoid secondhand smoke. Make sure that no one smokes in your home. Away from home, stay in smoke-free environments.</p>
              <p>3.Breast-feed your baby. If possible, breast-feed your baby for at least six months. Breast milk contains antibodies
                 that may offer protection from ear infections.</p>
                <p>4.If you bottle-feed, hold your baby in an upright position. Avoid propping a bottle in your baby's mouth while he or
                 she is lying down. Don't put bottles in the crib with your baby.</p>
                <p>5.Talk to your doctor about vaccinations. Ask your doctor about what vaccinations are appropriate for your child. Seasonal
                 flu shots, pneumococcal and other bacterial vaccines may help prevent ear infections.
