            Polio, or poliomyelitis, is a disabling and life-threatening disease caused by the poliovirus.
            The virus spreads from person to person and can infect a person’s spinal cord, causing paralysis (can’t move parts of the body). This can occur over a few hours to a few days. The weakness most often involves the legs, but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head, neck, and diaphragm.Many people fully recover.In those with muscle weakness, about 2 to 5 percent of children and 15 to 30 percent of adults die.Up to 70 percent of those infected have no symptoms        </p>

          <p>
            About of polio can be caused by a wide range of disorders, infections and events including:

               <pre>

                Poliovirus is very contagious and spreads through person-to-person contact.
                It lives in an infected person’s throat and intestines.
                Poliovirus only infects people. It enters the body through the mouth and spreads through:
                
                Contact with the feces (poop) of an infected person.
                Droplets from a sneeze or cough of an infected person (less common).
                You can get infected with poliovirus if:
                
                You have picked-up minute pieces of feces on your hands, and you touch your mouth.
                You put in your mouth objects like toys that are contaminated with feces.
                An infected person may spread the virus to others immediately before and up to 2 weeks after symptoms appear.
                
                The virus can live in an infected person’s feces for many weeks. It can contaminate food and water in unsanitary conditions.
                People who don’t have symptoms can still pass the virus to others and make them sick.</pre>

            Successful treatment depends on diagnosing the cause. Investigations may include:

               <pre>
                Doctors often recognize polio by symptoms, such as neck and back stiffness, 
                abnormal reflexes, and difficulty swallowing and breathing. To confirm the 
                diagnosis, a sample of throat secretions, stool or a colorless fluid that
                 surrounds your brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid) is checked for poliovirus.

          <p>
            Always see your doctor if you experience serious symptoms. Babies and young children with polio need prompt medical attention.
            Treatment for polio depends on the cause, but may include:

               <pre>
                There are two types of vaccine that can prevent polio:

    Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) given as an injection in the leg or arm, depending on the patient’s age.
    Only IPV has been used in the United States since 2000.Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) is still used throughout
    much of the world.Polio vaccine protects children by preparing their bodies to fight the poliovirus. Almost all 
    children (99 children to 100 out of 100) who get all the recommended doses of the inactivated polio vaccine will be protected from polio.
