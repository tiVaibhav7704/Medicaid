            Gallstones are hardened deposits of digestive fluid that can form in your gallbladder. </p><p>Your gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ on the right side of your abdomen, just beneath your liver.</p>

           <p>The gallbladder holds a digestive fluid called bile that's released into your small intestine.</p><p>Gallstones range in size from as small as a grain of sand to as large as a golf ball.

          <p>
            It's not clear what causes gallstones to form. Doctors think gallstones may result when:
                <p>1.Your bile contains too much cholesterol.</p>
                <p>2.Your bile contains too much bilirubin</p>
                <p>3.Your gallbladder doesn't empty correctly.</p>

        <h2>Diagnosis of gallstone</h2>
      <div class="land">
        <div class="lname">
          <p>
            Tests and procedures used to diagnose gallstones and complications of gallstones include:</p>
                <p>1.Abdominal ultrasound. </p>
                <p>2.Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS).</p>
                <p>3.hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan.</p>
                <p>4.computerized tomography (CT).</p>
                <p>magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). </p>

      <h2>Treatment of gallstone</h2>
      <div class="land">
        <div class="lname">
          <p>
            Treatment options for gallstones include:</p>
                <p>Surgery to remove the gallbladder (cholecystectomy)-> Your doctor may recommend surgery to remove your gallbladder, since gallstones frequently recur. Once your gallbladder is removed, bile flows directly from your liver into your small intestine, rather than being stored in your gallbladder.</p>
                <p>Medications to dissolve gallstones-> Medications you take by mouth may help dissolve gallstones. But it may take months or years of treatment to dissolve your gallstones in this way, and gallstones will likely form again if treatment is stopped.</p>
