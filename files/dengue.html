            Dengue is present in over 150 countries – more than 40% of the world’s population live in at-risk areas. While most 
            reported cases are in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Western Pacific, dengue also is present in many African 
            countries. The disease is spreading to parts of Europe, the USA and China.Dengue fever is transmitted to humans 
            through the bites of infected female mosquitoes. Aedes mosquitoes (especially Aedes aegypti) are the primary vectors. 
            After virus incubation, an infected mosquito is capable of spreading the virus for the rest of its life.These mosquitoes
             are found in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. They live in urban habitats and breed mostly in man-made 
             containers (like buckets of water, potted plants etc) .

      <h2>Cause</h2>
      <div class="land">

          <p>
            About of dengue can be caused by a wide range of disorders, infections and events including:

               <p>
                Dengue fever is caused by any one of four types of dengue viruses.</p><p> You can't get dengue fever from being around an 
                infected person.</p><p> Instead, dengue fever is spread through mosquito bites.The two types of mosquitoes that most often 
                spread the dengue viruses are common both in and around human lodgings. When a mosquito bites a person infected with 
                a dengue virus, the virus enters the mosquito.</p><p> Then, when the infected mosquito bites another person, the virus 
                enters that person's bloodstream and causes an infection.After you've recovered from dengue fever, you have long-term
                immunity to the type of virus that infected you — but not to the other three dengue fever virus types.</p><p> This means 
                you can be infected again in the future by one of the other three virus types. Your risk of developing severe dengue 
                fever increases if you get dengue fever a second, third or fourth time.

        <h2>Diagnosis of dengue</h2>

          <p>
            Successful treatment depends on diagnosing the cause. Investigations may include:

               <p>
                Doctors can diagnose dengue infection with a blood test to check for the virus or antibodies to it.</p><p> If you become 
                sick after traveling to a tropical area, let your doctor know.</p><p> This will allow your doctor to evaluate the 
                possibility that your symptoms were caused by a dengue infection.</p>

          <p>
            Always see your doctor if you experience serious symptoms. Babies and young children with diarrhoea need prompt medical attention.
Treatment for diarrhoea depends on the cause, but may include:</p>
              <p>1.plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration.</p>
              <p>2.oral rehydration drinks to replace lost salts and minerals.</p> 
              <p>3.intravenous replacement of fluids in severe cases.</p>
              <p>4.medications such as antibiotics and anti-nausea drugs.</p>
              <p>5.anti-diarrhoeal medications, but only on the advice of your doctor. </p>
              <p>6.treatment for any underlying condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease.</p>
               </p>
          </p>
            <p>
                There is no specific medicine to treat dengue infection.</p><p> If you think you may have dengue fever, you should use 
                pain relievers with acetaminophen and avoid medicines with aspirin, which could worsen bleeding.</p><p> You should also 
                rest, drink plenty of fluids, and see your doctor.</p><p> If you start to feel worse in the first 24 hours after your 
                fever goes down, you should get to a hospital immediately to be checked for complications.</p>
