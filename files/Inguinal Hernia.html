          An inguinal hernia occurs when tissue, such as part of the intestine, protrudes through a weak spot in the abdominal muscles. The resulting bulge can be painful, 
          especially when you cough, bend over or lift a heavy object. However, many hernias do not cause pain.

          An inguinal hernia isn't necessarily dangerous. It doesn't improve on its own, however, and can lead to life-threatening complications. 
          Your doctor is likely to recommend surgery to fix an inguinal hernia that's painful or enlarging. Inguinal hernia repair is a common surgical procedure.

          <p>
            The symptoms associated with Inguinal hernia include:

            <p>1.A bulge in the area on either side of your pubic bone, which becomes more obvious when you're upright,
               especially if you cough or strain</p>
            <p>2.A burning or aching sensation at the bulge</p>
            <p>3.Occasionally, pain and swelling around the testicles when the protruding intestine descends into the scrotum</p>
            <p>4.A heavy or dragging sensation in your groin</p>
            
          </p>

          <p>
            Some inguinal hernias have no apparent cause. Others might occur as a result of:
            <p>1.Increased pressure within the abdomen</p>
            <p>2.Straining during bowel movements or urination</p>
            <p>3.Strenuous activity</p>
            <p>4.Chronic coughing or sneezing</p>

        <h2>Diagnosis of Inguinal hernia</h2>
      <div class="land">
        <div class="lname">
          <p>
            A physical exam is usually all that's needed to diagnose an inguinal hernia. Your doctor will check for a bulge in the groin area. Because standing and coughing can make a hernia more prominent, you'll likely be asked to stand and cough or strain.

            If the diagnosis isn't readily apparent, your doctor might order an imaging test, such as an abdominal ultrasound, CT scan or MRI.
