          Autism spectrum disorder is a condition related to brain development that impacts how a person perceives and socializes with others, causing problems in social interaction and communication. The disorder also includes limited and repetitive patterns of behavior. 
          The term "spectrum" in autism spectrum disorder refers to the wide range of symptoms and severity.</p>

         <p> Autism spectrum disorder includes conditions that were previously considered separate â€” autism, Asperger's syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and an unspecified form of pervasive developmental disorder. 
          Some people still use the term "Asperger's syndrome," which is generally thought to be at the mild end of autism spectrum disorder.</p>

          <p>
            Because autism spectrum disorder varies widely in symptoms and severity, making a diagnosis may be difficult. There isn't a specific medical test to determine the disorder.
             Instead, a specialist may:
            <p>1.Observe your child and ask how your child's social interactions, communication skills and behavior have developed and changed over time</p>
            <p>2.Give your child tests covering hearing, speech, language, developmental level, and social and behavioral issues</p>
            <p>3.Present structured social and communication interactions to your child and score the performance</p>
            <p>4.Use the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association</p>
          </p>
