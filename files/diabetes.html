            Diabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how your body uses blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is vital to 
            your health because it's an important source of energy for the cells that make up your muscles and tissues. It's also your 
            brain's main source of fuel.The underlying cause of diabetes varies by type. But, no matter what type of diabetes you have,
            it can lead to excess sugar in your blood. Too much sugar in your blood can lead to serious health problems.

            <p>4.Unexplained weight loss</p>
           <p>5.Presence of ketones in the urine (ketones are a byproduct of the breakdown of muscle and fat that happens when there's not enough available insulin)</p>

            About of diabetes can be caused by a wide range of disorders, infections and events including:

               <p>To understand diabetes, first you must understand how glucose is normally processed in the body.

              <p>How insulin works? Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach (pancreas).</p>
              <p>The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream.</p>
               <p>The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells.</p>
              <p>Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream.</p>
              <p> As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas.</p>
              <p> The role of glucose.</p>
              <p>Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.</p>
              <p>Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver.</p>
              <p> Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.</p>
              <p>Your liver stores and makes glucose.</p>

            Successful treatment depends on diagnosing the cause. Investigations may include:

               <p>
                Symptoms of type 1 diabetes often appear suddenly and are often the reason for checking blood sugar levels. 
                Because symptoms of other types of diabetes and prediabetes come on more gradually or may not be evident, the American 
                Diabetes Association (ADA) has recommended screening guidelines.</p>
              <p>Initial glucose challenge test. You'll begin the glucose challenge test by drinking a syrupy glucose solution. One hour later,
                you'll have a blood test to measure your blood sugar level. A blood sugar level below 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) is usually considered
                normal on a glucose challenge test, although this may vary at specific clinics or labs.</p><p>If your blood sugar level is higher than normal, 
                it only means you have a higher risk of gestational diabetes. Your doctor will order a follow-up test to determine if you have 
                gestational diabetes.Follow-up glucose tolerance testing.</p><p> For the follow-up test, you'll be asked to fast overnight and then have
                your fasting blood sugar level measured. Then you'll drink another sweet solution — this one containing a higher concentration of 
                glucose — and your blood sugar level will be checked every hour for a period of three hours.If at least two of the blood sugar 
                readings are higher than the normal values established for each of the three hours of the test, you'll be diagnosed with 
                gestational diabetes.</p>
