        <pre>
            Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

            Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness
            and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill 
            and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions 
            like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more 
            likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously
            ill or die at any age. 
            
            The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease 
            and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 
            1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using 
            an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.
            
            The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when 
            they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets 
            to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into 
            a flexed elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.

            To prevent the spread of COVID-19:

               <pre>
               
                 1.Maintain a safe distance from others (at least 1 metre), 
                 even if they don’t appear to be sick.

                 2.Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when 
                 physical distancing is not possible.

                 3.Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones.
                 Open a window if indoors.

                4.Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-
                  based hand rub.

                5.Get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Follow local guidance 
                about vaccination.

                6.Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue
                when you cough or sneeze.

                7.Stay home if you feel unwell.

                8.If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, 
                 seek medical attention. Call in advance so your healthcare 
                provider can direct you to the right health facility.

                This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.

                                               <h3>Masks</h3>
                Properly fitted masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person
                wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and
                should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the 
                advice provided by your local health authority.
