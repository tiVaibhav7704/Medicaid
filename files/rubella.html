            Rubella is a contagious disease caused by a virus. Most people who get rubella usually have a mild illness, with symptoms that can include a 
            low-grade fever, sore throat, and a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Rubella can cause a miscarriage or 
            serious birth defects in a developing baby if a woman is infected while she is pregnant. The best protection against rubella is MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine.        </p>

          <p>
            About of rubella can be caused by a wide range of disorders, infections and events including:

               <pre>
                Rubella spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Also, if a woman is infected with rubella while she is pregnant,
                she can pass it to her developing baby and cause serious harm. See Pregnancy and Rubella page to learn more.A person with
                rubella may spread the disease to others up to one week before the rash appears, and remain contagious up to 7 days after. 
                However, 25% to 50% of people infected with rubella do not develop a rash or have any symptoms, but they still spread it to others.

            Successful treatment depends on diagnosing the cause. Investigations may include:

               <pre>
                The rubella rash can look like many other viral rashes. So doctors usually confirm rubella with the help of laboratory tests.
                You may have a virus culture or a blood test, which can detect the presence of different types of rubella antibodies in your blood. 
                These antibodies indicate whether you've had a recent or past infection or a rubella vaccine.
