          An allergy is a reaction by your immune system to something that does not bother most other people. 
          People who have allergies often are sensitive to more than one thing. Allergies can cause a variety of symptoms such as
          a runny nose, sneezing, itching, rashes, swelling, or asthma. Allergies can range from minor to severe. Anaphylaxis is a
          severe reaction that can be life-threatening. Doctors use skin and blood tests to diagnose allergies. Treatments include
          medicines, allergy shots, and avoiding the substances that cause the reactions

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>

          <p>
            The symptoms associated with allergies include:

               <p>
                1.Mild reactions include local symptoms (affecting a specific area of your body) such as a rash or hives, itchiness,
                 watery/red eyes, hay fever and runny nose. Mild reactions do not spread to other parts of your body.</p>
                 <p>2.Moderate reactions include symptoms that spread to other parts of your body. Symptoms may include itchiness, hives, and/or 
                swelling and trouble breathing.</p>
                <p>3.A severe allergic reaction, known as anaphylaxis, is a rare, life-threatening emergency in which your body’s response to the
                allergen is sudden and affects the whole body.</p><p> 4.Anaphylaxis may begin with severe itching of your eyes or face. Within minutes, 
                more serious symptoms appear, including throat swelling (which could cause problems with swallowing and breathing), abdominal
                pain, cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, hives and swelling (angioedema). You may also have mental confusion or dizziness, since 
                anaphylaxis may cause a drop in blood pressure.</p>

          <p>
            About of allergies can be caused by a wide range of disorders, infections and events including:

               <p>
                1.Airborne allergens, such as pollen, animal dander, dust mites and mold.</p>
                <p>2.Certain foods, particularly peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish, eggs and milk.</p>
                <p>3.Insect stings, such as from a bee or wasp.</p>
                <p>4.Medications, particularly penicillin or penicillin-based antibiotics.</p>
                <p>5.Latex or other substances you touch, which can cause allergic skin reactions.</p>

        <h2>Diagnosis of allergies</h2>
      <div class="land">

          <p>
            Successful treatment depends on diagnosing the cause. Investigations may include:

               <p>
                Anything that you come into contact with that your body views as a “harmful invader” can be a cause of an allergy. 
                Normally harmless substances that are common causes of allergies include pollen, animal dander, mold, dust, foods, insect
                venom and latex.Technically, your symptoms are the result of a chain of events that are your body’s response to the 
                “harmful invader.” Your body “sees” the invader, makes antibodies to fight the invader, and in so doing, releases histamines 
                that cause your allergy symptoms.

      <h2>Treatment of allergies</h2>
      <div class="land">

          <p>
            Always see your doctor if you experience serious symptoms. Babies and young children with allergies need prompt medical attention.
Treatment for allergies depends on the cause, but may include:

               <p>
                1.Avoid known triggers. Even if you're treating your allergy symptoms, try to avoid triggers. If, for instance, you're allergic 
                to pollen, stay inside with windows and doors closed when pollen is high. If you're allergic to dust mites, dust and vacuum and 
                wash bedding often.</p>
                <p>2.Keep a diary. When trying to identify what causes or worsens your allergic symptoms, track your activities and what you eat, 
                when symptoms occur and what seems to help. This may help you and your doctor identify triggers.</p>
                <p>3.Wear a medical alert bracelet. If you've had a severe allergic reaction, a medical alert bracelet (or necklace) lets others 
                know that you have a serious allergy in case you have a reaction and you're unable to communicate.</p>
